    "1. Make sure you submit the solutions before the deadline (Sunday May 8, 2022 by midnight). Late submission will be penalized as follows: late within one day (24 hours): 15% penalty; late within two days: 30% penalty, late within three days: 40% penalty. Submission after three days will not be accepted.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Discussion with classmates on the problems is not allowed. All clarification questions should be directed to me. You should be responsible for the debugging of the code. I have provided a lot of check points to help you gain confidence of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Make sure you rerun the whole Jupyter file one last time before submission. When I grade your code, I will run the code from scratch, and I will grade based on what I get. It happens sometimes that you unintentionally change some code that has been debugged and re-introduce some bugs. Rerunnning the whole code one final time before submission prevents that happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. After you submit your code, it is your responsibility to check if you submitted the correct file. Sometimes an empty file is submitted by mistake. I will treat any resubmissions past the deadline that are due to such mistakes as late submissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Please utilize the time wisely. Do not wait until the last minute to work the problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The data files needed are: 'movie_ids.txt', 'movieParams.mat' and 'movies.mat'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hope you enjoy the project and good luck! "

    "\\textbf{Part 1b (5 pts)}:  Compute the average movie rating for the first movie--Toy Story with the np.mean function (Note that the average rating should be ONLY calculated with the ratings that are greater than 0. A zero value in $Y$ means no rating was given and should not be counted in the averaging.) in two ways: 1) Use Only $Y$; 2) Use $Y$ and $R$, where $R$, after converted to bool type, can be used to select the numbers (columns) in $Y$ that will be used for averaging. You should get the same average with the two methods."

The $\\Theta$ matrix represents the features of the users, e.g., the $j$th row, $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(j)}$, may represent how much user $j$ is interested in each of the 10 features (genres) of the movies. \n",

    "## Part 7--Preprocessing the data: mean-normalize $Y$\n",
    "\n",
    "We are very close to training the model on the entire data: $Y$ and $R$! One more step before that is to preprocess the rating data $Y$. We will perform the mean-normalization for $Y$: for each row of $Y$, find the row mean and subtract it from every nonzero number of the row. For example, if a row is $[3, 4, 5, 0]$, the row mean is (3+4+5)/3 = 4 (not counting 0), and mean-normalizing the row will give us $[-1, 0, 1, 0]$ (again 0 is not touched).\n",

    "You have found the row mean in Part 1 for the first row, so it should be straightforward to find the row means for all rows. Then the mean-normalization should be easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "Doing this makes more sense for the users who did not provide any ratings. For a user who did not make any ratings, the model based on the mean-normalized data will use the mean of all the other users' ratings to an movie as the prediction for the user on the movie, while the model based on the original data will use 0.\n",

Then we would like to predict your rating to the 5th movie based on the ratings to the movie given by say 10 other users who are most similar to you. For example, we can use the average of the ratings given by 10 other most similar users. To measure the similarity of two users, we usually use the cosine similarity (distance). The cosine similarity of the $i$th column of $Y$ and the $j$th column of $Y$ (after centering) would  give us the similarity of the $i$th user and the $j$th user. So this is actually a K-nearest neighbor problem.\n",
